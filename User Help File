To use this device, you must first plug it into a power source using the USB cable. Then, when the circuit board is lit, you can begin
using the semaphore translater.

To start, press the first letter of the message you intend to communicate. When the LEDs flash on the red circle, mirror the placement
with your arms holding flags. When you have done this you can press the next key you need to transmit.

When you have finished, simply unplug the translator.
