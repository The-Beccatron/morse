# morse - semaphore adaption
An arduino powered semaphore code sender.


For this project, I built on the keyboard from the morse sender and added a circle of LEDs to the stripboard.

I have been using a Diecimila Arduino.


This project currently:
  Has LEDs on pins:
  When a key is pressed, the corresponding semaphore pattern flashes.
  
For the keyboard, I used a matrix design, using 6 columns and 5 rows which is scanned in the program.
